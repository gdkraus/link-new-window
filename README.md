link-new-window
===============

CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) to automatically add notifications to links that open in new windows to make them more accessible.

When you have links that open in new windows, you should notify users that the link will open in a new window.

WCAG 3.2.2
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#consistent-behavior

Having links open in new windows can be disorienting to screen reader users, screen magnifier users, and users with certain cognitive disabilities.

This solution automatically adds an icon with alt text to all images with target ="_blank" to notify users that a link will open in a new window.

This implementation is based on the W3C example at http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20120103/G201.
